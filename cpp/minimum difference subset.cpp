/*
    Given a set of integers, 
    the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between 
    their sums is minimum. 
    If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m elements, 
    Subset2 must have n-m elements and the value of abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.

    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/partition-a-set-into-two-subsets-such-that-the-difference-of-subset-sums-is-minimum/

- Knapsack pattern
- simply modify the subset sum problem which is straightforward

idea:
- we want two subsets s1 and s2 s.t. abs(s2-s1) ==> minimum
- let arr sum is S then if s2 = S-s1 , which means we want to minimize S-2s1
- Now we need to find the subset s1
- this subset can range between {} to {whole array} i.e. [0-S]
- so we can assume s1 to be in [0-S/2] range to minimize the difference
- now we want the subset s1 between [0-S/2] which minimize the S-2s1
- we can try subset sum for s1 from sum= 0 to S/2 but since there may be sum which cannot
  be formed with the array array elements 
- so we need to ignore these sum
- to find all the candidate subarray between 0-S/2 we can use subset sum dp table's last row
